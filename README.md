Iâ€™m currently the Director of Technology at Blueprint Digital where I work with some of the brightest people in the tech industry. 

In my spare time I'm learning Kotlin because I just got a cool watch and I have an idea for an app.

I live in Queens, New York (the greatest borough in the greatest city in the world).

Pronouns: he/him
